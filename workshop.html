        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p class="tagline">
            <strong>Bridging Machine Learning (ML) \& Combinatorial Optimization (CO) -- from  ML for CO to CO for ML. Advancing foundations, scalability, and real-world AI-driven decision making. </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Machine learning (ML) and combinatorial optimization (CO) are two foundational paradigms for solving large-scale real-world problems. ML maps data into high-dimensional continuous parameter spaces and optimizes models through gradient-based, data-driven learning, enabling breakthroughs in image recognition, language processing, and robotics. In contrast, CO focuses on complex discrete decision-making, leveraging advanced search, sampling, and branch-and-cut algorithms to address challenges in scheduling, planning, routing, hardware/chip design, drug discovery, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            In recent years, the synergy between ML and CO has expanded exponentially. ML has increasingly accelerated CO solvers through automated heuristic discovery, learned search guidance, especially for nonconvex, uncertain, and large-scale problems that are evasive to off-the-shelf human solvers. Reciprocally, CO provides the fundamental reasoning and constrained search frameworks integral to modern ML systems, enhancing their expressiveness, efficiency, and reliability from training to inference. Looking ahead, CO serves a pivotal domain distinguished by different inductive biases (say, from vision and language), such as decision-making landscape representation and reasoning, motivating next-generation AI systems for countless applications. Together, these trends signal a deep co-evolution of ML and CO that is reshaping the future of AI-driven decision-making.
        </p>
        <p>
            The workshop will feature invited speakers across two complementary tracks: <em>(a) ML for CO Track</em>,, focusing on ML-driven methods for CO, and <em>(b) CO for ML Track</em>, showcasing how combinatorial techniques, particularly discrete searching/sampling/reasoning, can enhance ML. By bringing together these perspectives, the workshop aims to capture this emerging direction, foster cross-community dialogue, and position the ML-CO interface as a timely research agenda for the ICML community.

        <h2>Scope and Goals</h2>
        <p>
            This workshop explores the growing intersection of machine learning (ML) and combinatorial optimization (CO), with a focus on both ML4CO and CO4ML. We welcome contributions across a wide range of topics within <strong>ML4CO</strong>, including but not limited to <em>Differentiable CO solver</em>, <em>Neural CO solver/Generative CO solver</em>, and <em>Automatic CO Algorithm Discovery</em>. On the <strong>CO4ML</strong> side, we invite works that leverage combinatorial frameworks to address the inherent discrete challenges within structured machine learning tasks, such as <em>Combinatorial Matching&Structural Alignment</em> and <em>Decoding/Search Algorithm for LLMs</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            By bringing together these communities, we aim to foster new collaborations and inspire innovative research directions at the intersection of ML and CO. By fostering shared understanding and encouraging contributions to common infrastructure—such as benchmarks, scalable tools, and system-level integrations—we hope to accelerate mutual progress and strengthen the foundation for future breakthroughs.
