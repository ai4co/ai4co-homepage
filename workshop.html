        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p class="tagline">
            <strong>Bridging Machine Learning (ML) & Combinatorial Optimization (CO): from ML for CO to CO for ML. Fostering collaboration for breakthroughs, foundation models & real-world impact.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Combinatorial optimization (CO) underpins a wide range of real-world applications, including vehicle routing, chip design, smart city planning, and drug discovery. However, developing effective heuristics for diverse CO problems has long been challenging due to their inherently discrete and non-convex nature, which traditionally requires substantial human expertise and manual design. Recent advances in AI have begun to transform this landscape by introducing learning-based heuristics, reinforcement learning, and neural-guided search methods that significantly enhance CO solving. In particular, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has further automated and generalized heuristic design, enabling CO problems to be approached in a more flexible and efficient manner. These developments make CO not only more practical for complex real-world scenarios but also a fertile ground for advancing fundamental AI methodologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the same time, many core AI challenges can be formulated as CO problems. Examples include (i) discrete sampling: LLM decoding and beam search, discrete diffusion models; (ii) neural‐network design: model pruning, model merging, neural architecture search; and (iii) matching/alignment tasks: object detection, entity matching, cross‐domain alignment. These are not edge cases but fundamental, high‐impact tasks at the heart of modern AI systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            This workshop aims to bridge the gap between the CO and AI communities and encourage deeper collaboration. To highlight impact in both directions, we will feature invited speakers from two complementary tracks: <em>(a) ML for CO Track</em>, with researchers advancing and applying ML methods for CO; and <em>(b) CO for ML Track</em>, with leading researchers introducing powerful tools that can revolutionize AI applications, and particularly advanced search methodologies.

        <h2>Scope and Goals</h2>
        <p>
            This workshop explores the growing intersection of machine learning (ML) and combinatorial optimization (CO), with a focus on both ML4CO and CO4ML. We welcome contributions across a wide range of topics within <strong>ML4CO</strong>, including but not limited to <em>Neural-based CO Solvers</em>, <em>GPU-accelerated solvers</em>, <em>Foundation Models for CO</em>, <em>LLM for CO</em>, and <em>Learning-guided Optimization</em>. On the <strong>CO4ML</strong> side, we invite work that applies combinatorial techniques to solve structured machine learning tasks, such as <em>Neural-Network Design</em>, <em>Matching/Alignment tasks</em>, and <em>CO for Discrete Sampling</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            By bringing together these communities, we aim to foster new collaborations and inspire innovative research directions at the intersection of ML and CO. By fostering shared understanding and encouraging contributions to common infrastructure—such as benchmarks, scalable tools, and system-level integrations—we hope to accelerate mutual progress and strengthen the foundation for future breakthroughs.

        <h2>Community Building</h2>
        <p>
            Collaboration across machine learning, operations research, and diverse ML applications is essential for the success of ML and CO. This workshop will serve as a platform to spark dialogue, inspire novel solutions, and drive future advances. We aim to build lasting connections among researchers, practitioners, and industry professionals. Designed as the start of an ongoing workshop series, we will foster a growing, supportive community with long-term engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have launched the <strong>AI4CO Community</strong> which includes an active Slack channel that already hosts 330+ members and is open to all interested in ongoing collaboration. Join our community to stay connected with the latest developments in the intersection of AI and combinatorial optimization.
